Wireless sensor networks (WSN), are similar to wireless ad hoc networks in the sense that they rely on wireless connectivity and spontaneous formation of networks so that sensor data can be transported wirelessly. Sometimes they are called dust networks, referring to minute sensors as small as dust. Smart dust is a U C Berkeley project sponsored by DARPA. Dust Networks Inc., is one of the early companies that produced wireless sensor network products. WSNs are spatially distributed autonomous sensors to monitor physical or environmental conditions, such as temperature, sound, pressure, etc. and to cooperatively pass their data through the network to other locations.[4] The more modern networks are bi-directional, also enabling control of sensor activity. The development of wireless sensor networks was motivated by military applications such as battlefield surveillance; today such networks are used in many industrial and consumer applications, such as industrial process monitoring and control, machine health monitoring, and so on.
